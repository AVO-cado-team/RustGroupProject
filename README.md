## Project Description
Implementation of a double-linked list using different approaches, one of which is unsafe code.
The project must contain testing and benchmarks.  
Knowledge to be gained:
- Understanding of Rust concepts such as memory security, thread security, and ownership system.
- Understanding of the basic principles of working with collections in Rust, including the use of iterators.
- Practical skills in implementing algorithms for working with a double linked list, such as adding, removing, and updating elements in the list.
- Practical skills in writing tests to verify a double linked list implementation in Rust.
- Skills in working with documentation on Rust and writing understandable documentation for our code.

## Project Requirements
- Implementation of double linked list data structure in Rust in at least 2 ways with one API.
- Implementation of methods for adding, removing, and modifying elements in the double linked list.
- Ensuring proper handling of pointers and references to elements in the double linked list in Rust.
- Ensuring memory safety when using the double linked list in Rust.
- Writing tests to verify the correctness of the double linked list in various conditions.
- Formatting the code according to Rust recommendations and including comments for better code understanding.
- Documenting the code, including descriptions of the main methods and data structures in the double linked list, using the Rustdoc system.
